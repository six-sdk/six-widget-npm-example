# Using widgets from NPM
This repo contains a minimal example of using SIX widgets from NPM using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) to create a bundle for the browser.

The example includes the [six-population-widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/six-population-widget).

## Getting started

Clone this repo and update `src/index.js` with a fresh API token.

Then run `yarn && yarn run start` (or `npm install && npm start`) and open your browser with `http://localhost:8080/example/`.
